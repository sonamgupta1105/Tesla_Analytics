# Tesla_Analytics
project for ANLY 500 50

Let's start analyzing !!

Update on 03/27/2016: Clem has uploaded PROJECTTESLA.xlsx which has the analysis of Tesla's stock prices vs oil prices. It also has the report on the analysis. The file might be too big to see it on here, so you will need to download and then read it. 


Research question: The question we are trying to solve focuses on how Tesla's sales performance is affected by fuel prices. For this task, we established our null hypothesis to be fluctuations in fuel prices will not affect the sales performance whereas our alternate hypothesis is that the fuel pricess may affect the sales. 

We have the following data collected on which we plan to base our analysis upon:
1. Stock Prices of Tesla since 2010
2. Electric vehicle sales information for 2014,15 and 16
3. Tesla 2015 - 10K statement
4. Fuel Prices historic data
5. Fuel prices divided by regions in US
6. Other data - (that may be helpful): states that promote Electric vehicles by offering incentives, median incomes by state etc.

These files are uploaded on this repository. 

Few ideas towards implementation: 
1. With the stock prices data and sales information for other electic vehicles, we plan to create a scatter plot in order to get a rough idea about the relationship between them, hence to test our hypotheses. 
2. Qualitative and Quantitative analysis
